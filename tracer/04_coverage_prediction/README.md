`c_coverage_prediction_separate_lines.jsonl` contains sequences in separate_lines format for the entire dataset.
`splits_separate_lines` contains dataset splits generated by splitting up c_coverage_prediction_separate_lines.jsonl.

Inside `splits_separate_lines` there is a file containing the problem IDs in train/val/test, as well as a file containing submission IDs and the corresponding sequences as jsonl.

```
splits_separate_line
├── test.jsonl                  <-- sequences in test set
├── test_problems.txt           <-- submission IDs in test set
├── test_submissions.txt        <-- problem IDs in test set
├── train.jsonl
├── train_problems.txt
├── train_submissions.txt
├── valid.jsonl
├── valid_problems.txt
└── valid_submissions.txt
```

## Splitting method
1. All submissions from a given problem ID are put into the same set.
2. Identical problem clusters (documented in project codenet distribution) are put into the same set as well.
